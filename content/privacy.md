As used in this policy, “personal information” means information that would allow someone to identify you, including your name, email address, IP address, or other information from which someone could deduce your identity.

The Loop Church of the Nazarene and Compassionate Ministries (collectively “LoopNaz”) receive and use personal information in the following ways:

**Website analytics:** When you visit our Websites and use our Services, LoopNaz collects some information about your activities through tools such as Google Analytics. The type of information that we collect focuses on general information such as country or city where you are located, pages visited, time spent on pages, heat-map of visitors’ activity on the site, information about the browser you are using, and so forth. LoopNaz collects and uses this information pursuant to our legitimate interest in enhancing the security and utility of our Services. The information we gather and process is used in the aggregate to spot trends without deliberately identifying individuals, except in cases where you engage in a transaction with LoopNaz by donating money, purchasing merchandise, or buying a ticket for an event or program. In those cases, LoopNaz retains certain information about your visit to the Services, including information about the referral site that led you to our Services, pursuant to its legitimate interest in understanding its community of supporters for fundraising purposes, and this information is stored in connection with other personal information you provide to LoopNaz.

Note that you can learn about Google’s practices in connection with its analytics services and how to opt out of it by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

**Information from Cookies:** We and our service providers (for example, Google Analytics as described above) may collect information using cookies or similar technologies for the purposes described above and below. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on the hard drive or memory of your computer or other Internet access device.  Cookies may enable us to personalize your experience on the Services, maintain a persistent session, passively collect demographic information about your computer, and monitor advertisements and other activities. The Websites may use different kinds of cookies and other types of local storage (such as browser-based or plugin-based local storage).

**Donations:** When you [donate money to LoopNaz][support] or pay for attendance to a ticketed event hosted by LoopNaz, you will be asked to provide personal information, including payment information. LoopNaz collects and uses this personal information pursuant to its legitimate interest in raising funds to ensure the sustainability of our not-for-profit organization and, where applicable, to provide you with the items you purchased. 

## Retention of Personal Information

The majority of the personal information collected and used as explained above is aggregated and stored in a central database provided by a third party service provider. LoopNaz aggregates this data pursuant to its legitimate interest in having information stored in a single location to minimize complexity, increase consistency in internal practices, better understand its community of supporters and volunteers, and enhance the security of the data.  

LoopNaz erases the web browser logs described above on a regular, rolling basis. We generally retain other personal information for the purposes for which it was collected. This may mean that we retain your personal information indefinitely in some cases.

## Access to Your Personal Information

You are generally entitled to access and transfer to a third party any personal information that LoopNaz holds and to have inaccurate data corrected or removed to the extent LoopNaz still maintains it. In certain circumstances, you also may have the right to object or restrict for legitimate reasons to the processing or transfer of personal information. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please [contact us][contact] explaining your request. You also have the right to go directly to the relevant supervisory or legal authority, but we encourage you to contact us so that we may resolve your concerns directly as best we can.

## Disclosure of Your Personal Information

LoopNaz does not disclose personal information to third parties except as specified elsewhere in this policy and in the following instances:

* LoopNaz may share personal information with our contractors and service providers in order to undertake the activities described in Section 3.  

* We may disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms and this Privacy Policy; (c) enforce our Articles of Incorporation, or (d) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

## Third Party Service Providers

LoopNaz uses many third party service providers in connection with the Services, including website hosting services and credit card processing, among others. Some of these service providers may place session cookies on your computer, and they may collect and store your personal information on our behalf in accordance with the data practices and purposes explained above. 

## Third Party Sites

The Services may provide links to a wide variety of third party websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other websites.

## Location of Services

If you are accessing or using the Services in regions with laws governing data collection, processing, transfer and use, please note that when we use and share your data as specified in this policy, we may transfer your information to recipients in countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information.

The Services are currently hosted on [GitHub pages][github]. This may change from time to time. The majority of contractors that LoopNaz is using as of the effective date of this Privacy Policy are located in the United States, but this may change from time to time. 

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will provide you with notice of such update through (at a minimum) a reasonably prominent notice on the Websites and Services, and will revise the Effective Date. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting, using, processing and transferring the personal information we collect.
