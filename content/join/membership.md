## Our Church Can Be Your Home

Everyone is welcome at our tables and in our services. 

Membership is a great way to deepen your involvement in the life of the church.

Being a member in the Church of the Nazarene makes you part of a global family. And joining LoopNaz offers opportunities to shape our local branch of that family for generations.

Your unique perspective as a member helps us fulfill our God-given [mission][mission] together.

If you’re interested in becoming a member, please [contact us][contact]. Our pastor will personally assist you with any questions you may have while learning more about our history, beliefs, and what to expect as a member in the Church of the Nazarene in Chicago.

Her are some of basics. (Feel free to [ask us questions too][contact].)

## Agreed Statement of Belief

The International Church of the Nazarene follows these eight brief statements as our basis for membership.

> We Believe:
>
> 1. In one God—the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 
> 1. The Old and New Testament Scriptures, given by plenary inspiration, contain all truth necessary to faith and Christian living.
> 1.Human beings are born with a fallen nature, and are, therefore, inclined to evil, and that continually. 
> 1. The finally impenitent are hopelessly and eternally lost.
> 1. The atonement through Jesus Christ is for the whole human race; and that whosoever repents and believes on the Lord Jesus Christ is justified and regenerated and saved from the dominion of sin.
> 1. That believers are to be sanctified wholly, subsequent to regeneration, through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
> 1. The Holy Spirit bears witness to the new birth, and also to the entire sanctification of believers.
> 1. Our Lord will return, the dead will be raised, and the final judgment will take place.

> <cite>_Manual of the Church of the Nazarene: 2017–2021_, [para. 20–20.8][manual-asb].</cite>

## The Church

As a denomination, we also unite around sixteen “[Articles of Faith][manual-aof]” to articulate our shared beliefs more fully and to help us fulfill our common mission _to make Christlike disciples in the nations_. Here is Article XI on “the Church.”

> We believe in the Church, the community that confesses Jesus Christ as Lord, the covenant people of God made new in Christ, the Body of Christ called together by the Holy Spirit through the Word.

> God calls the Church to express its life in the unity and fellowship of the Spirit; in worship through the preaching of the Word, observance of the sacraments, and ministry in His name; by obedience to Christ, holy living, and mutual accountability.

> The mission of the Church in the world is to share in the redemptive and reconciling ministry of Christ in the power of the Spirit. The Church fulfills its mission by making disciples through evangelism, education, showing compassion, working for justice, and bearing witness to the kingdom of God.

> The Church is a historical reality that organizes itself in culturally conditioned forms, exists both as local congregations and as a universal body, and also sets apart persons called of God for specific ministries. God calls the Church to live under His rule in anticipation of the consummation at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

### Church Membership

Here are links to two documents our international church provides to help introduce new believers and new members: [_Nazarene Essentials: Who We Are—What We Believe_][essentials] and [_One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism: Essential Teachings for Faith Formation in the Church of the Nazarene_][onelord]

#### _Nazarene Essentials_

{{< vimeo 181994098 >}}

For clergy and laity, [_Nazarene Essentials_][essentials] offers a way to better understand the church’s purposeof spreading scriptural holiness and its mission to make Christlike disciples in the nations.

#### _One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism_

{{< figure src="/img/jpg/onelord-breakingbread.jpg" >}}

As our denomination expands globally, it is appropriate to identify not only our distinctives, but how our theology derives from Holy Scripture, and harmonizes with the church’s tradition over two millennia, with human reason enlightened by the Holy Spirit, and with Christian experience. [_One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism: Essential Teaching for Faith Formation in the Church of the Nazarene_][onelord], is just such an initiative.
