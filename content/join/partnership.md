## Let’s make a difference—together

We can do more together than we could ever do apart. And we’re so glad you’re interested in joining with us as a compassionate ministry partner.

We welcome any and all business and organizations who wish to work with us in our mission of compassion to our neighbors in greatest need. And we are eager to volunteer for projects and initiatives through your business or organization too.

Please [contact us][contact] to connect with our [Board of Directors][leadership].

As a small gesture of thanks, we share a list of our [partners][partners] with links to each of their sites.
