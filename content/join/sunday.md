## You're invited!

**When:** Sundays 10:30 a.m.

**Where:** 633 S Plymouth Ct, #703, Chicago, IL 60605

On Sunday mornings we meet in the home of Reuben and Stephanie Lillie.

Each week we post readings and additional event details on [Twitter][twitter] and [Facebook][facebook] to help you prepare for our time together and to make it easier for you to invite others through social media.

If you can, please [let us know][contact] ahead of time that you're coming. If you’re driving, then we’re happy to help you find a parking spot. If you’re taking public transit, then we can meet you at the train or bus stop.

Each Sunday we share a time of prayer and reflection on passages from the [_Revised Common Lectionary_][rcl]

Then we'll share the [Lord's Supper][communion] together.

_Please note that out of respect for those with or overcoming addictions, food allergies, or dietary restrictions, at LoopNaz we offer only non-alcoholic juice and we bake bread fresh each week so that it is gluten free, nut free, nightshade free, and vegan._
