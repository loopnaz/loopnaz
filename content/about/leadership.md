## Our Pastor

{{< figure src="/img/jpg/rlillie_headshot_square.jpg" title="Reuben L. Lillie" class="float-left" >}}

In July 2018, Reuben and his family accepted the call to establish the Loop Church of the Nazarene in downtown Chicago. This marks the first official presence of the Church of the Nazarene here since 1906. And, with the organization of the Loop Nazarene Compassionate Ministries, Inc. on Octboer 13, 2018, “LoopNaz” (for short) became the first ever Nazarene Compassionate Ministry center in Chicago city limits.

Prior to founding LoopNaz, Reuben served the Hyde Park area for four years through the Reach77 Network in conjunction with his studies at McCormick Theological Seminary. He and his wife Stephanie have been living and serving through urban missions in Chicago since they both graduated from Olivet Nazarene University in 2011. In that time, Reuben has also completed graduate studies in music through the Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University.

Reuben is an active professional singer, educator, researcher, and writer. He is currently working on two books with fellow Olivet faculty members. And he continues to perform in opera productions, recitals, and concerts throughout the country.

Inquiring minds may also wish to know that Reuben is a member of the [White Castle Craver’s Hall of Fame][white-castle] class of 2012. (It’s a heart-warming story that might just make you hungry.)

Reuben and Stephanie host [Sunday][sunday] gatherings in their home with their son Corban and their cat Tibbs.

## Our Field Student 

{{< figure src="/img/jpg/efetzer_headshot_square.jpg" title="Meet Elise Fetzer!" class="float-left" >}}

Elise is a senior at Olivet Nazarene University from Oak Lawn, IL. She will be graduating in May 2019 with a degree in Intercultural Studies. Elise is serving with LoopNaz both to receive field experience for her degree program and because she believes God is behind our mission in Chicago. After graduation, Elise hopes to continue sharing the love and mercy of God by serving and living in solidarity with marginalized populations.

As part of her field studies, Elise is keeping an online [journal][elise-author]. Please read and pray along with us. Thanks Elise!
