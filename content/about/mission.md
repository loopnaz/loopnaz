## Your actions reveal what you _actually_ believe.

Anything worth believing is worth doing. This simple truth is the hallmark of any vital faith. And it's the heartbeat of the Church of the Nazarene and Nazarene Compassionate Ministries.

As Nazarenes, we're convinced that discipleship doesn't just happen—in fact, it _can’t happen without compassion_. Our name is our constant reminder and open invitation to follow the example of Jesus of Nazareth in caring for those who suffer among us and to share hope.

> <span class="blue">Following the example of Jesus, Nazarene Compassionate Ministries (NCM) partners with local Nazarene congregations around the world to clothe, shelter, feed, heal, educate, and live in solidarity with those who suffer under oppression, injustice, violence, poverty, hunger, and disease. NCM exists in and through the Church of the Nazarene to proclaim the Gospel to all people in word and deed.</span>

Some of the greatest fortunes are won and lost in our neighborhood—on the same streets as some of the most severe poverty in North America. 

We are a local Church of the Nazarene, and we are a Nazarene Compassionate Ministry Center in Chicago’s Loop. Our purpose flows from identifying with Jesus, our cosmopolitan city, and our global church in service to them both.
