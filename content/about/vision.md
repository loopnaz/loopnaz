Any vision we cast must help us chart a path from our [mission][mission] and [values][values].

**Let’s run with this:** [We pray][pray], [we care][care], and [we share][share] _to meet our neighbors’ immediate and long-term physical and spiritual needs in personable and sustainable ways_.

This vision ensures that our mission of discipleship begins and ends with compassion. 1 John 4:19 serves as a striking reminder and challenge: “We love because God first loved us.” Compassionate ministry is the most effective method we have for connecting with our neighbors—both those who need care and those with whom we can partner to care for others like Jesus showed us.

> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br/>
&emsp;because the Lord has anointed me.<br/>
He has sent me to preach good news to the poor,<br/>
&emsp;to proclaim release of the prisoners,<br/>
&emsp;and recovery of sight to the blind,<br/>
&emsp;to liberate the oppressed,<br/>
&emsp;and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.
