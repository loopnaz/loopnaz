If the Corporation should wish to dissolve; or should relocate or attempt to relocate its principal office outside the Loop, or otherwise cease to offer all or most of its compassionate ministry services within the Loop; or in the event of its withdrawal or attempted withdrawal from its partnership with the Church of the Nazarene, then any property of the Corporation that may exist shall in no way be diverted to other purposes, but title shall pass to the Local Church acting as agent for the Corporation, or other authorized agents, for the use of the Local Church at large, as its board shall direct. If, however, the Local Church should become inactive or disorganized, or in the event of its withdrawal or attempted withdrawal from the Church of the Nazarene, then any property of the Local Church that may exist shall in no way be diverted to other purposes, but title shall pass to the authorized agents as provided by the [_Manual_][manual], and the chair shall submit a written request to these agents that such property be used by the Corporation as a registered Nazarene Compassionate Ministry Center through another entity of the Church of the Nazarene operating within the Loop.
