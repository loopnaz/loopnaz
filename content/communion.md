Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”",

## Come and Dine

We offer communion every [Sunday][sunday].

In the Church of the Nazarene, we believe this meal is a sacrament—a holy encounter with God—proclaiming Jesus’s life, sufferings, death, resurrection, and the hope of Christ’s coming again.

We acknowledge God’s presence among us in a special way each time we celebrate the Lord’s Supper. We also desire to remember anew the death Jesus endured. And we receive afresh the life into which Christ’s Holy Spirit calls us.

We invite everyone to participate. And we want everyone to be able to participate.

In other words, you don’t have to be a [member][membership] of our local church or the Church of the Nazarene. And if you’ve not yet been baptized, then we’d further like to invite you to [connect with us][contact] so we can prepare for that sacrament together too.

_Please note that out of respect for those with or overcoming addictions, food allergies, or dietary restrictions, at LoopNaz we offer only non-alcoholic juice and we bake bread fresh each week so that it is dairy free, egg free, gluten free, nightshade free, nut free and vegan._

## Communion Bread Recipe

The following recipe is modified from the January 2014 article, “The Quest for a Common Loaf,” by Angela Dienhart Hancock for the [_Christian Century_][common-loaf]. If your diet restricts any of these ingredients, then please [contact us][contact] before the Sunday you plan to visit and we’ll do our best to accommodate you. Thanks for helping us make the table as open and accessible as possible.

### Ingredients

![Communion Bread Ingredients][communion-bread-ingredients]

2 1/2 cups warm water (105–110°F)<br/>
2 1/4 tbsp active dry yeast (1 packet)<br/>
1 tbsp raw honey

125g (1 cup) garbanzo bean flour<br/>
125g (1 cup) tapioca flour<br/>
80g (1/2 cup) sweet white rice flour<br/>
80g (1/2 cup) gluten-free cornmeal<br/>
1/2 tsp salt (finely ground kosher or sea salt)

26.66g (1/3 cup) whole psyllium husks <br/>
54g (1/3 cup) whole chia seeds<br/>
2 tbsp maple syrup<br/>
2 tbsp olive oil

### Directions

In a medium bowl, combine warm water and honey; gently stir in yeast with whisk or fork; allow to activate for 10 minutes.

In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients with whisk or sifter.

After the yeast has activated, add psyllium husks, chia seeds, syrup, and oil to wet ingredients, stirring gently, allowing to activate for an additional 2–3 minutes, stirring once more before adding to dry ingredients.

Fold activated wet ingredients into mixed dry ingredients; then turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead 5–10 minutes; place kneaded dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a warm damp towel, and proof for 40 minutes to 1 hour.

After first proof, begin preheating oven to 400°F (with a pizza stone on a lower center rack); punch down proofed dough and knead on a lightly floured surface 1–2 minutes; then, on parchment paper, form dough into a 10 inch round loaf; with a sharp knife, score top making a crosshatch pattern; brush or coat with oil and allow to proof for another 30 minutes.

After the second proof, place the loaf and parchment in oven and bake 40–50 minutes until dark golden brown.
