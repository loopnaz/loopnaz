      <description>The Loop Church of the Nazarene may have taken seed in 2018, but our church’s roots in Chicago reach back as far as 1900.
From those initial meetings in the Philpot’s home over a century ago, to opening the Southside Pentecostal Mission in 1903, to the tent meeting in 1904 that became Chicago First, to hosting the First General Assembly in 1907—the legacy of Nazarenes in Chicago is rich and inspiring.</description>

 The Mission of the International Church of the Nazarene   to make Christlike disciples in the nations
The Church of the Nazarene
 As Nazarenes, we&amp;rsquo;re convinced that discipleship doesn&amp;rsquo;t just happen—in fact, it can’t happen without compassion.</description>

      <description>We Pray When we say “we pray”—we mean it.
Prayer is our highest priority and our primary method for engaging our neighbors.
Everything we do begins and ends and comes out of our response through prayer.
We take a daily prayer walk around our community outside points of interest like government buildings, schools, train stations, and parks. Whether you’re in the Loop often or this is your first time, we’re here to pray with you and for you and for our neighbors.</description>

      <description>Any vision we cast must help us chart a path from our mission and values.
Let’s run with this: We pray, we care, and we share to meet our neighbors’ immediate and long-term physical and spiritual needs in personable and sustainable ways.
This vision ensures that our mission of discipleship begins and ends with compassion. 1 John 4:19 serves as a striking reminder and challenge: “We love because God first loved us.</description>

      <description>Our Pastor  Reuben L. Lillie   In July 2018, Reuben and his family accepted the call to establish the Loop Church of the Nazarene in downtown Chicago. This marks the first official presence of the Church of the Nazarene here since 1906. And, with the organization of the Loop Nazarene Compassionate Ministries, Inc. on Octboer 13, 2018, “LoopNaz” (for short) became the first ever Nazarene Compassionate Ministry center in Chicago city limits.</description>

      <title>Orientation: Check?</title>

      <description>This past Saturday was my orientation with the Loop Church of the Nazarene and Compassionate Ministries. For the majority of this orientation, Reuben and I spent a good three or so hours that afternoon walking around the northern portion of the Loop, in theory to get me better acquainted with the area.
However, the term orientation might be a bit misleading. Rather than feeling like I gained any reasonable acquaintance with the neighborhood, I realized just how much I don’t know about it.</description>

      <description>Come and Dine We offer communion every Sunday.
In the Church of the Nazarene, we believe this meal is a sacrament—a holy encounter with God—proclaiming Jesus’s life, sufferings, death, resurrection, and the hope of Christ’s coming again.
We acknowledge God’s presence among us in a special way each time we celebrate the Lord’s Supper. We also desire to remember anew the death Jesus endured. And we receive afresh the life into which Christ’s Holy Spirit calls us.</description>
