      <description>Letâ€™s celebrate a job well done!
Thank you Elise Fetzer for your faithful service to LoopNaz. You are a credit to your parents, your home church, and Olivet Nazarene University.
During her last semester break of her last year of college, from December 16, 2018 to January 13, 2019, Elise spent 88 hours over the course of 18 days with us in Chicago as part of her cross-cultural ministry field experience toward her Bachelor of Arts in Intercultural Studies.</description>
