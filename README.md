_Serving the heart of Chicago_<sup><abbr title="Trademark">TM</abbr></sup>

Welcome to the sourcecode repository for LoopNazâ€™s website.

We are both a local church and a not-for-profit.

Our mission is to make Christlike disciples by clothing, sheltering, feedings, healing, educating, and living in solidarity with those who suffer under oppression, injustice, violence, poverty, hunger, and disease in the City of Chicago and beyond.

For more information, view our site at https://loopnaz.org/.

## Theme
